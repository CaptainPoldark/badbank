## About

This is project was made to practice using React, React States, creating a user session, etc.
When first accessing the app from the link above a React Bootstrap card should be shown letting 
you know that this isn't the banking app you're looking for. If you click "Create Account" you
can create an account. This app temporarily saves your account until you refresh the browser.

If you prefer to use another premade account refer to the credentials below.

After logging in, the "Create Account" and "Login" navigation tabs will be replaced with the 
following:

Deposit - Deposit money. An alert will display if the transaction is not possible.

Withdraw - Withdraw money. An alert will display if the transaction is not possible.

Balance - Shows current balance, and Amount and type of last transaction.

AllData - Presents information, for all users in the current state. Displays balance, transactions, 
credentials, and wether the user is logged in or not. Clicking logout won't reset this information.
This allows for logging into mutiple accounts, and making changs serially.

## Credentials

Though it isn't required to use a pre-made account, they've been created for convenience, and verifying
state information.

There are four pre-made accounts. One of which is:

Email: jneutron@protonmail.com
Password: Goddard

None of the "user" data provided was meant to represent real email accounts. If a real email is identical 
one of the accounts in the mock database for this app, it was unintentional.

## Roadmap

Styling improvements
Sending money or requesting money to other users in the state
